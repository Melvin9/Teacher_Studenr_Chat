# Teacher_Student_Chat
Student-Teacher Interaction Application:
This project focuses on building a simple yet effective method for a student to get across doubts to a community of students as well as teachers. 
This is achieved by using a program that lets students register an account and post their doubts on a forum where everyone is able to view as well as answer the doubts.
The student is given an added fuctionality of only asking the doubts to a specific teacher. The specific doubt can be sent to the teacher by providing the teachers ID.
Students can also answer questions and earn points.

The teacher login lets the teachers login and answer questions addressed to them.
Teachers can also moderate the answers given by students in case they contain wrong information. 
Teachers are also able to verify correct answers submitted by students and award them points for contributing. 
Students can also check their Scoreboard.


This application is also able to work in real time if 2 users are on 2 different computers. 
Apart from the q&a forum implementation, students are given an extra functionality of viewing the latest notices from KTU which has been implementated by using web-scraping.
The asked questions,submitted answers as well as login details are stored into databases in an online server.


Storing the data has been make possible by using php  files convert data so that it is able to be stored into tables using SQL commands. 
Web scraping and other operations in the program have been done through python. 
The GUI has been created by using the GUI development software, PYQt.
